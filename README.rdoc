Welcome to the app formerly known as lazy_date, Couch-Concierge.

The one stop shop for people in the DC area to get suggestions on where to get takeout and what movie to watch on Netflix.

It's pretty much the best thing in the world.

Pretty straight forward to get it to run.

You'll have to pull it down then

1. bundle

2. rake db:migrate

3. rake get_takeout_menus (this will take about 15 minutes, so be patient)

4. rake db:seed

That should be it.
